# Large-Scale Social and Complex Networks

## [Project 1: Random Graphs and Random Walks](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Large-Scale_Social_and_Complex_Networks/tree/master/Project1)

### Content

- Generate large random networks using Erdős–Rényi (ER) model and Preferential Attachment (PA) model.
- Analyze community structure of large networks, including Giant Connected Component (GCC) size and modularity.
- Modify preferential attachment model to penalize the age of a node in large random graph.
- Implemente random walk on large random network to simulate Google’s PageRank algorithm.

## [Project 2: ](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Large-Scale_Social_and_Complex_Networks/tree/master/Project2)

### Content

- Explore structural properties of undirected social network (Facebook dataset) using connectivity and degree distribution.
- Explore structural properties of personalized network of core nodes using Fast-Greeedy, Edge-Betweenness, and Infomap community detection algorithms.
- Explore characteristics of nodes in the personalized networks using Embeddedness and Dispersion.
- Implement friend recommendation in personalized networks using neighborhood-based measures, including common neighbor measure, Jaccard measure, and Adamic-Adar measure, and evaluate with average accuracy measure.
- Explore the community structure of directed social network (Google+ dataset), defined by homogeneity and completeness.
