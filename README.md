## [Project 1: Random Graphs and Random Walks](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Large-Scale_Social_and_Complex_Networks/tree/master/Project1)

### Content

- Generate large random networks using Erdős–Rényi (ER) model and Preferential Attachment (PA) model.
- Analyze community structure of large networks, including Giant Connected Component (GCC) size and modularity.
- Modify preferential attachment model to penalize the age of a node in large random graph.
- Implemente random walk on large random network to simulate Google’s PageRank algorithm.
